PCAF's Data Quality Scores (score 1-5) are used to qualify the level of precision of the estimates we disclose per PCAF asset class. Data quality scores are specific to each asset class. Data with PCAF scores 1/2 , (verified and unverified respectively) company-level reported emissions data, represent the highest data quality and results in the most accurate emissions tial real estimates. This is followed by physical activity-based emissions (PCAF score 3), and PCAF scores 4/5, given for an economic activity-based emissions approach. We strive to include the best data quality score based on data availability and feasibility. s Details on the average data quality score per portfolio can be found in Appendix 3 of the Annual Report s for each of these short-term effo ts on the 12 sector x region combinations with the highes carbon emi sion contributions (e.g. re iden estate in the Netherlands or soy production in Brazil). For each of these segments, we have identified scientific decarbonization pathways indicating how much and how rapidly each sector x region combination must reduce its em ssion in order to align with the 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature goal. We have set emissi ns reduction target sector x region combinations and report annually on our progress in the table in Appendix 2.

## More Customers Reporting Emissions

Thanks to increased availability of data and improved methodologies, this year we are able to report financed emissions for 89% of the relevant (71% of our total assets) on-balance sheet assets in our portfolio, covering all of the most carbon-intensive sector x region combinations of our financing activities. We see that customer-reported data is growing significantly withy almost 60% of our wholesale lending now calculated using reported emissions. We also see important improvements in selfreported GHG emissions in our Rural portfolio (see next sections for more details). In 2023, the CRREM decarbonization pathway was updated and we adjusted the targ ts for the relevant sector x region combinations accordingly: Residential Real Estate (RRE) in the Netherlands and Commerc al Real Estate (CRE) in the Netherlands. In addit on, in the Energy/Power Generation sector, we saw a sizeable growth in the portfolio of both Energ Wholesale and Project Finance and therefore decided to distinguish betwee two sector x region combinations, a d set targe s for each.

A Decrease in Financed Emissions Following our efforts to encourage farmers to measure on-farm emissions (see section below on Emissions reduction targets

Our financed emissions in 2022 have decreased by 5% compared to 2021 1 , dropping from 51.5 MtCO2e to 48.8 MtCO2e. This reduction in absolute emissions comes despite a 2% increase in the size of our loan portfolio. Our financed emissions decreased in both our Dutch and international financing activities. The decreases in our residential real estate and the Dutch business customer portfolios appear consistent with the general trends we see in these sectors of the Dutch economy. And we are confident that our Road to Paris approach is helping more and more customers transition to a climate smart future.m However, as we are still largely reliant on modelled emissions calculations, we cannot draw specific conclusions on the roleS our own climate mitigation activities have played in achieving these results. A range of other factors, including high energy w prices, government policies and incentives and changes to customer financials also impact the results. ry sector) also show an in the F&amp;A sector) and our collaboration with value chain partners, we can now calculate emissions intensities for our Australian beef por folio. Unfortunately, a lack of farm-level emissions data and production values mean that we still cannot determine the carbon intensity for our remaining rural sector x regions (New Zealand Dairy, US Beef and Soy Brazil). However, emissions data fro the US National Inventory report (allocated to the beef sector) and FAO production data indicates an overall decline in the U beef sector emissions intensities b tween 2019 and 2021. Sector production data from Dairy Companies Association of Ne Zealand and Dairy NZ and emissions data from the NZ National Inventory Report (allocated to the dai overall decline in emissions intensity in NZ Dairy between 2019 and 2021. For the Brazil Soy sector we are not able to

## Avoided Emissions Increase disaggregate soy production emissions from the larger grains and oilseeds sector.

Our avoided emissions have increased by 10% - from 4.8 Mt CO2 to 5.3 Mt CO2. This increase is linked to a 25% increase in our loans to the renewable power generation sector. Rabobank plans to more than triple its investments in this sector by 2030 (compared to our base year 2020) or setting a 2030 absolute target on the CO2e emissions of our customer portfolio.

The biggest potential for positive impact lies in helping our customers transition to low-emitting business models. We have millions of customers around the world and we want all of them to successfully transition to the low-carbon future. However, we realize that the need to act and our ability to help differs per customer segment. Therefore, we have focused our

- 1 Note that the pathway and portfolio intensity numbers are aligned in emissions boundaries, but the values in the SBTi FLAG pathways are derived in a methodologically different way (the FLAG sector-region default value comes from a top-down model, our portfolio intensity value comes from a bottom-up calculator, with carbon footprints calculated based on primary data collected from our customers). This makes direct comparison difficult.
- 2 The performance measure is equal to the baseline reference year due to availability of data.
- 3 The 2020 financed emissions were not measured.
- 4 Financed (physical) volumes of oil and gas converted to million barrels of oil equivalent/day. This is our first assessment of financed (physical) fossil volumes. We are working with other banks to develop a methodology for traded fossil fuels, which may differ from the current methodology
