## PCAF's Data Quality Scores

PCAF's Data Quality Scores (score 1-5) are used to qualify the level of precision of the estimates we disclose per PCAF asset class. Data quality scores are specific to each asset class. Data with PCAF scores 1/2, (verified and unverified respectively) company-level reported emissions data, represent the highest data quality and results in the most accurate emissions estimates. This is followed by physical activity-based emissions (PCAF score 3), and PCAF scores 4/5, given for an economic activity-based emissions approach. We strive to include the best data quality score based on data availability and feasibility. Details on the average data quality score per portfolio can be found in [Appendix 3](#) of the Annual Report. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.113,r=0.958,b=0.246), with ID 062b57b2-88ee-4ff1-bc2c-dffb36ffac66 -->

## More Customers Reporting Emissions

Thanks to increased availability of data and improved methodologies, this year we are able to report financed emissions for 89% of the relevant (71% of our total assets) on-balance sheet assets in our portfolio, covering all of the most carbon-intensive sector x region combinations of our financing activities. We see that customer-reported data is growing significantly with almost 60% of our wholesale lending now calculated using reported emissions. We also see important improvements in self-reported GHG emissions in our Rural portfolio (see next sections for more details). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.279,r=0.962,b=0.411), with ID 8454adeb-52bd-45f1-9954-ba2b8cb063b0 -->

## A Decrease in Financed Emissions

Our financed emissions in 2022 have decreased by 5% compared to 2021, dropping from 51.5 MtCO2e to 48.8 MtCO2e. This reduction in absolute emissions comes despite a 2% increase in the size of our loan portfolio. Our financed emissions decreased in both our Dutch and international financing activities. The decreases in our residential real estate and the Dutch business customer portfolios appear consistent with the general trends we see in these sectors of the Dutch economy. And we are confident that our Road to Paris approach is helping more and more customers transition to a climate smart future. However, as we are still largely reliant on modelled emissions calculations, we cannot draw specific conclusions on the role our own climate mitigation activities have played in achieving these results. A range of other factors, including high energy prices, government policies and incentives and changes to customer financials also impact the results. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.444,r=0.961,b=0.645), with ID 15d98eb9-deac-4e4b-98ff-832a0078b27f -->

## Avoided Emissions Increase

Our avoided emissions have increased by 10% - from 4.8 Mt CO2 to 5.3 Mt CO2. This increase is linked to a 25% increase in our loans to the renewable power generation sector. Rabobank plans to more than triple its investments in this sector by 2030 (compared to our base year 2020). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.679,r=0.962,b=0.764), with ID b924e51a-ba39-4855-ab76-d1ab659c254b -->

## Emission Reduction Targets

The biggest potential for positive impact lies in helping our customers transition to low-emitting business models. We have millions of customers around the world and we want all of them to successfully transition to the low-carbon future. However, we realize that the need to act and our ability to help differs per customer segment. Therefore, we have focused our <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.796,r=0.963,b=0.881), with ID 98ebc1ae-c1b2-4e8b-a92e-1d46fffc2bce -->

Financed emissions data reported this year refer to 2022 results unless otherwise indicated. This is due to delays in the publication of national emissions data required for top-down calculations, which we still use for the majority of our financed emissions calculations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.509,t=0.911,r=0.959,b=0.946), with ID f3233d55-7ed1-4dcb-8e32-551afe268957 -->

## Our Impact in 2023 - Better World

This text appears to be part of a page footer, indicating a focus on the impact made in the year 2023 towards creating a better world. <!-- page_footer, from page 0 (l=0.037,t=0.943,r=0.143,b=0.956), with ID 53876723-2dd9-4fbc-adf7-245024068c1f -->

## Description of the Figure

The image is a simple representation of a mathematical symbol, specifically an "equals sign" (`=`). It consists of two parallel horizontal lines, centered within a blue square background. The lines are white, contrasting with the blue background, and are of equal length and thickness. The overall design is minimalistic, focusing solely on the symbol without any additional text, labels, or annotations. This symbol is commonly used in mathematics to denote equality between two expressions. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.934,t=0.000,r=0.961,b=0.051), with ID 5d880d90-f93f-4d1d-a6a0-14d000667729 -->

## Notes

1. Note that the pathway and portfolio intensity numbers are aligned in emissions boundaries, but the values in the SBT FLAG pathways are derived in a methodologically different way (the FLAG sector-region default value comes from a top-down model, our portfolio intensity value comes from a bottom-up calculator, with carbon footprints calculated based on primary data collected from our customers). This makes direct comparison difficult.

2. The performance measure is equal to the baseline reference year due to availability of data.

3. The 2020 financed emissions were not measured.

4. Financed (physical) volumes of oil and gas converted to million barrels of oil equivalent/day. This is our first assessment of financed (physical) fossil volumes. We are working with other banks to develop a methodology for traded fossil fuels, which may differ from the current methodology. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.037,t=0.771,r=0.962,b=0.809); page 1 (l=0.037,t=0.819,r=0.318,b=0.833); page 1 (l=0.036,t=0.842,r=0.193,b=0.855); page 1 (l=0.036,t=0.865,r=0.907,b=0.879), with ID 1d215732-a585-4999-a538-0330695f4feb -->
