Data quality scores are specific to each asset class. Data with PCAF scores 1/2, (verified and unverified respectively) company-level reported emissions data, represent the highest data quality and results in the most accurate emissions estimates. This is followed by physical activity-based emissions (PCAF score 3), and PCAF scores 4/5, given for an economic activity-based emissions approach. We strive to include the best data quality score based on data availability and feasibility. Details on the average data quality score per portfolio can be found in [Appendix 3](#) of the Annual Report. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.113,r=0.958,b=0.246), with ID 062b57b2-88ee-4ff1-bc2c-dffb36ffac66 -->\\n\\n## More Customers Reporting Emissions\\n\\nThanks to increased availability of data and improved methodologies, this year we are able to report financed emissions for 89% of the relevant (71% of our total assets) on-balance sheet assets in our portfolio, covering all of the most carbon-intensive sector x region combinations of our financing activities. We see that customer-reported data is growing significantly with almost 60% of our wholesale lending now calculated using reported emissions. We also see important improvements in self-reported GHG emissions in our Rural portfolio (see next sections for more details). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.279,r=0.962,b=0.411), with ID 8454adeb-52bd-45f1-9954-ba2b8cb063b0 -->\\n\\n## A Decrease in Financed Emissions\\n\\nOur financed emissions in 2022 have decreased by 5% compared to 2021, dropping from 51.5 MtCO2e to 48.8 MtCO2e. This reduction in absolute emissions comes despite a 2% increase in the size of our loan portfolio. Our financed emissions decreased in both our Dutch and international financing activities. The decreases in our residential real estate and the Dutch business customer portfolios appear consistent with the general trends we see in these sectors of the Dutch economy. And we are confident that our Road to Paris approach is helping more and more customers transition to a climate smart future. However, as we are still largely reliant on modelled emissions calculations, we cannot draw specific conclusions on the role our own climate mitigation activities have played in achieving these results. A range of other factors, including high energy prices, government policies and incentives and changes to customer financials also impact the results. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.444,r=0.961,b=0.645), with ID 15d98eb9-deac-4e4b-98ff-832a0078b27f -->\\n\\n## Avoided Emissions Increase\\n\\nOur avoided emissions have increased by 10% - from 4.8 Mt CO2 to 5.3 Mt CO2. This increase is linked to a 25% increase in our loans to the renewable power generation sector. Rabobank plans to more than triple its investments in this sector by 2030 (compared to our base year 2020). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.679,r=0.962,b=0.764), with ID b924e51a-ba39-4855-ab76-d1ab659c254b -->\\n\\n## Emission Reduction Targets\\n\\nThe biggest potential for positive impact lies in helping our customers transition to low-emitting business models. We have millions of customers around the world and we want all of them to successfully transition to the low-carbon future. However, we realize that the need to act and our ability to help differs per customer segment.
